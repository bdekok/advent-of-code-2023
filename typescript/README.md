# Advent of Code 2021

My attempt of solving the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2022) puzzles.

## How to run the project

Make sure you've installed [Deno](https://deno.land/) and run from the main project folder.

```deno run --allow-read main.ts```

If you want to run the tests 

```deno test```
